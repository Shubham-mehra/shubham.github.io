Designed and developed the next-generation GUI platform for **FAME (Functional Automation Made Easy)**, Spectrum’s patented internal testing and automation system (U.S. Patent 11,436,128 B2). Delivered a modern, user-friendly web application that allows internal teams to create test data, build and execute automation scripts, manage performance testing, and track devices in real time.

Led the **full-stack development** using **React + Next.js** on the frontend and **Python** backend services connected to **Oracle DB**, with CI/CD pipelines in **GitLab** for seamless deployment. Built secure REST APIs, role-based access control, and real-time dashboards for execution results and defect tracking, significantly improving automation efficiency and usability across multiple teams within Charter.
