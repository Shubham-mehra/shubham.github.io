A next-generation web platform for Spectrum’s patented internal testing and automation system, FAME (U.S. Patent 11,436,128 B2). Built a completely new GUI using React and Next.js with a Python backend and Oracle database integration, enabling internal teams to create test data, develop automation scripts, manage performance testing, and track devices through an intuitive interface. Integrated GitLab CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins triggers, and real-time reporting dashboards to streamline automation workflows and improve tester productivity across multiple Charter teams.
